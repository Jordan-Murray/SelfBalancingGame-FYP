# SelfBalancingGame-FYP

**Project Description**

This project will explore creating a generalised game balancing automation solution; utilising an example racing game to illustrate how an automated system can reduce testing resources and therefore increase throughput for developers when releasing new characters/ playable entities. Using an autonomous system will allow developers to; tune characters to specific win rates over hundreds of thousands of AI (Artificial Intelligence) runs, choose a balancing strategy (prioritise buffing over nerfing / vis versa) and reduce costs for new character releases.

**Project Aims**

The aim of this project is to create an autonomous game balancing engine that will reduce the resources developers devote to testing, giving smaller studios more resources to creating new and exciting content for players. It will also aim to increase player satisfaction upon new character releases in an online competitive game. It will do this by allowing higher quality and more frequent testing, therefore, reducing the chance of new characters being grossly unbalanced.
